Our setup would most likely point the running process directly at a Gerrit repository on disk, which is the actual `.git` that pushes end up happening to. This is fairly easy to figure out though.\n\nSo you want to accept edit from both the webUI and `git bug push` at the same time. That make sense.\n\nWhen the webUI or any other command run, the cache lock the repo, which prevent any other command to process. Any ... but a push as this is git itself, not git-bug. It works well for a personal usage: you can't alter the repo concurrently and you can't pull new changes while something else happen. This mechanism doesn't protect from pushes though, which is a problem in hosting situation.\n\nThe other problem is indeed that the cache is at the moment not aware that a push happen and won't invalidate or update the entities in memory or update the index.\n\nMaybe a server-side git hook could solve that ? This hook would monitor git pushes, look if a git-bug entity has been updated, and inform the running process (the one started with `webui`) of that through an additional API endpoint. The cache would then perform the required invalidation.\n\n_Originally posted by @MichaelMure in https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/pull/407#issuecomment-646366806_","files":null}]}
