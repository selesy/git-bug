The question is rather if and how git-bug should be made aware of the normal coding process.\n\nI see two possibilities:\n\n- an \"active\" solution: git-bug listen (via hooks) to events in git (commit, merge ...) and trigger bug changes from that\n- a \"passive\" solution: git-bug store extra metadata (for example, what branch is concerned by the bug, what commit fix it), and is able to compute on demand the bug status (is the bug fixed in the current branch ?)\n\nA passive solution would be easier imho, but this needs more though. This is not only a technical question, it's also what feature do we really want here.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1534982694,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MDM5OTc1MjQ="},"nonce":"/glAn3AJ0uRSjP6usIMy4Xb84HQ=","added":["Core"],"removed":[]}]}
