Did you check ? The root command should list properly the subcommands as well as provide suggestion for typos.\n\n`git bug commands` was designed to be able to build command line completion tool and to generate documentation, but now that cobra does that (check the doc folder), it might be removed.\n\nI guess I should follow the same pattern for other commands as well ? For labels it should be:\n`git bug label \u003cid\u003e` list the labels\n`git bug label add \u003cid\u003e` add a label\n`git bug label remove \u003cid\u003e` remove a label\n\nThat's quite a lot of keystrokes though...\n\nI was also thinking about having a command like `git bug select \u003cid\u003e` that would select a bug as default for future edit with other commands. Good or bad idea ?","files":null}]}
