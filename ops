You have to do:\n\n$ go get -u github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug\n\nand then:\n\n$ cd ~go/src/github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug\n\n(which is basically cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug, if I'm not\nmistaken).\n\nIf I do that, make works as expected.\n\nThis seems super counter-intuitive for a programmer who is not used to Golang.\nMaybe this should be made a bit clearer in README.md.
