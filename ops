Inside a `Blob` is serialized an `OperationPack`, that is an array of edit operation on the bug's state.\n\nThis `OperationPack` is currently serialized using golang's [gob](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/), which is neat because it just works. However, it might not be the best option for interoperability with other tools in the future.\n\nHow should that be serialized ? Json ? In any case, git will compress the data using zlib so a text format might not be that terrible.\n\nFeel free to argue a case here.","files":null}]}
