It would be awesome if the full configuration chain could be supported, in order of precedence:\n\n- Local configuration -- `${REPO_ROOT}/.git/config`\n- User configuration -- `${HOME}/.gitconfig` or `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/git/config`\n- System configuration -- `/etc/gitconfig`\n\nAdditionally, following `include` directives would be useful -- the main application for which is likely keeping the authentication configuration out of the default user-scoped conffile which is stored in a repository for public sharing.","files":null}]}
