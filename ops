Your reply answers a few questions actually. Mainly that parallell accessing using multiple servlets (one per user) would not be a good idea. It would scale horribly badly and would probably still be race-condition prone.  Managing only two (the use-case described of `git bug push`-  i.e. server-side `git` itself and ONE `git-bug` service-daemon) is manageable though. In combination with git-hooks, feature could be solved by serialising requests into sessions (i.e. making the service itself stateful/state-aware).  But it's a detour and I like your thinking much better, especially since it also covers creation of new users and authorisation.\n\nPerhaps not a low hanging fruit though?\nUnfortunately I don't know go or I'd be willing to lend a hand.\n\nDo you have a ticket-number? I'd be happy to have a look and if deemed duplicate/overlapping we can close this one.","files":null}]}
