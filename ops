My use case at the moment is recovering github issues from the gharchive event logs, but it seemed the niche of making a general user interface for import or export was missing.  git has `git-fast-import` and `git-fast-export` for this.  They read or write to pipes in a way that anybody can write a script to interoperate with, to import or export repositories.\n\nI've found it is less work for me to simply augment the shell commands to accept more arguments and output more data if requested,which basically accomplishes the same goal: the using script ends up running commands instead of writing to or reading from a pipe.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\nIn the much longer term, if there were some simple general purpose pipe format, then making many projects interoperate can get much easier (consider git-issue, BugsEverywhere, git-ssb) because it comes down to getting them to support one import and export format, rather than writing bridges between every combination of pairs.\n\nWhat do you think about small obscure use cases like gharchive import?","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1606081427,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTg1MTg5Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/489#issuecomment-731851896"},"nonce":"hYErkVJbEfu8GP9sVn8ZlUMFWmM=","message":"#501 appears to address the exporting half of this wonderfully.
