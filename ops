Once the issue has been talked about, someone usually goes and implements something for it. Moving context to somewhere else doesn't seem intuitive (even though github, gitlab and gitea handle it this way). Mailing-lists don't have this distinction, and it doesn't make sense, I think. I think the solution might be to link a branch to the issue.","files":null}]}
