This means that:\n1. Each bug editions, user profile versions or configurations version will have a Lamport time specifying when they start to be effective\n2. User profiles and configurations will be versioned and it will be possible to query, say, what configuration was effective when the priority of a bug was modified.\n\nSo, in a way, the question is not really how a set of priority can be backward compatible, but more **how can different set of priorities can coexist for the same bug and across bugs**. As an example, let say that a bug start with a set of priorities, and this set change at some point. As the bug data is immutable, we need to be able to interpret the priorities coherently in the context of a bug, but also across multiple bugs.","files":null}]}
