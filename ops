Not sure what's the best solution though, it might be just an UX issue. Here is what I see as possible fix:\n- Finish the transaction concept (https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/337) and give more control to UIs over what is pending and allow to revert\n- Have the status change be \"less easy\":\n  - have a \"confirm\" step ?\n  - as the status will eventually have more values than open/closed, have a secondary UI to select the value\n- have a way to \"undo\", but that implies knowing what *can* be undo as you must not remove operation that were already propagated. This could be limited to the pending ops. There is also a more general notion here of *editing* the pending operation (especially comments).","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1586595321,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMjM4NDQyMDA="},"nonce":"v/kUUAbpQ+I7cXtYIV8S9in1PA8=","added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1586595328,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMjM4NDQzMTQ="},"nonce":"u9M6cWaXIJN6lQM8L8iCjL4Ixwg=","added":["TermUI"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1586595328,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyMjM4NDQzMTU="},"nonce":"KkbUZjQAzkkvWYV9YLVrpHR0H+g=","added":["WebUI"],"removed":[]}]}
