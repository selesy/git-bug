The repository's `LocalStorage` is hard-coded to the value \"git-bug\".  This is probably appropriate for applications that extend git-bug such as distributed Kanban boards, distributed code review, etc.  For applications that are not in any way related to git-bug, it's probably better to use a different location for `LocalStorage`.  While most of the rationale for these changes helps avoid the confusion of several applications sharing one `LocalStorage` directory, accidental reuse of the Lamport clocks could result in data consistency issues.\n\nIt's therefore recommended that the three functions that return a `GoGitRepo` be altered to accept and additional `applicationName` parameter.  Excluding test and example code, this change only requires that the environment setup in `commands/env.go` be changed to pass \"git-bug\" as the `applicationName`.","files":null}]}
