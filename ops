This completion scripts are based on the description of each commands (living in https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/tree/master/commands).\n\nAt the moment, those completion works decently, completing command names and flags. However it would be possible to do better. By teaching cobra (see https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/shell_completions.md#customizing-completions) about what is expected, it should be possible to:\n- disable the default completion showing files when it's not appropriate\n- complete based on git-bug specific terms (`git bug ls [tab][tab]` would also complete with [query qualifiers](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/doc/queries.md))\n- complete based on git-bug specific data (`git bug show [tab][tab]` would complete with bug Ids, possibly with the bug title)","files":null}]}
