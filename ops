The main goal has to be how well it does that job, not how easy it is to implement (as long as bugs are not an issue).\n\nFrom that point of view, I'm happy to consider weakness of the language, but note that it has also a quite strong characteristic: it's very similar to the one github ans others have (so it's familiar to most users). Also, changing the query language now is technically a breaking change, it has to be well motivated.\n\nI don't know what the issue is with the webUI, but it might be needed to re-implement the lexer/parser in javascript to easily modify a query: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/tree/master/query","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1621842475,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDc4NTE2ODAxNg=="},"nonce":"wGLbVwWwSOf9ADLsmjS4tolQaWc=","status":2}]}
