If you accessed the API via password authentication, then we recommend you use the web flow to authenticate. Please check that your app uses the web flow for authentication https://docs.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow\n\u003e\n\u003e You can learn more about these changes by visiting our developer blog https://github.blog/2020-07-30-token-authentication-requirements-for-api-and-git-operations/\n\nSorry to be the bearer!","files":null}]}
