If we don't add anything specific to the config, we only have the Lamport time (a number) at which it become active, or maybe a hash of the config. That's not really helping. Or we could require a user to name each version of the config, but that would probably leads to garbage name (\"config1\", \"config2\" and so on) that wouldn't help either.\n\n... or we could say by how many config version the value is outdated: `low (outdated by 2 versions)`. But that starts to be really verbose. I think I would just say `(outdated)` and wait until it actually becomes a problem to not know by how much.","files":null}]}
