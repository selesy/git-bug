This integration is fun but actually doesn't bring much positive to the table. It does though bring possible confusion and, more importantly, way longer commands to type.\n\nAdditionally, when future new entities get added (say, pull-requests or config), we'll need to move all bug related command to their own namespace. That will make the commands even longer and repetitive (`git bug bug add`).\n\nI've been thinking about the following organization:\n\n ```\n IDENTITY\n     gb user [USER-ID] [flags]\n     gb user adopt USER-ID\n     gb user create\n     gb user ls [flags]\n \n BUG\n     gb bug add [flags]\n     gb bug comment [ID]\n     gb bug comment add [ID] [flags]\n     gb bug label [ID]\n     gb bug label add [ID] LABEL...\n     gb bug label ls\n     gb bug label rm [ID] LABEL...\n     gb bug ls [QUERY] [flags]\n     gb bug ls-id [PREFIX]\n     gb bug rm ID\n     gb bug show [ID] [flags]\n     gb bug status [ID]\n     gb bug status close [ID]\n     gb bug status open [ID]\n     gb bug title [ID]\n     gb bug title edit [ID] [flags]\n \n     gb bug select ID\n     gb bug deselect    \n \n PR\n     gb pr add\n     gb pr show\n     gb pr status\n     ...\n \n     gb pr select ID\n     gb pr deselect    \n \n BRIDGE\n     gb bridge\n     gb bridge auth\n     gb bridge auth add-token [TOKEN] [flags]\n     gb bridge auth rm ID\n     gb bridge auth show\n     gb bridge configure [flags]\n     gb bridge pull [NAME] [flags]\n     gb bridge push [NAME]\n     gb bridge rm NAME\n \n REMOTE\n     gb pull [REMOTE]\n     gb push [REMOTE]\n \n UIs\n     gb termui\n     gb webui [flags]\n \n UTILITY\n     gb commands [flags]\n     gb version [flags]\n ```","files":null}]}
