It's a voluntary change in the query language where we allow to search with a triple `foo:bar:baz`. Before that, `label:st:wontfix` was interpreted (not by design) as `label` + `st:wontfix`. The correct way should be `label:\"st:wontfix\"` but maybe there is something wrong in the parser or in each UI?","files":null}]}
