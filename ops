You need to do it once and then it‘s done. It‘s not like your changing your makefile every release but if you are you are doing something very wrong.\n\nI'm doing this for a living mainly, and this isnt just a one time drop. You'll have to maintain each build system anytime there's a change in building system/pipelines. \nI really like the idea of the dormant bundled webserver, wanna use it? Enable it, otherwise just ignore it.\n\nDon't see the problem here. Wanna save 1MB of space, for how much work hours ?","files":null}]}
