First use a constant that is defined in the same file. Second is hard coded in the Sprintf call.\nA first trivial fix (very easy I may send a pull request today) is to change the hard coded value in snapshot.go (7 char seems to be the right value to match the 7 char ids generally provided in git and github). A better fix should be to use the same constant. To be defined is the way to manage such constant: into a dedicated go file or to import bug.go in snapshot.go.\nTo be checked: is there other alternative HumanId() functions hidden elsewhere?","files":null}]}
