It's really just a shortcoming of git because no one has a serious use case for that (yet). I wrote code in git-bug to do that manually. If that is fixed in git, the data model allow for automatic merge.\n\nFYI, it is possible, but not \"trivial\". The raw Git commands to do this are in [this file](https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-git-workarea/blob/master/src/prepare.rs#L296). Basically, you make a new index file and work tree and convince Git that things are OK and then you can operate as normal (though only files that Git needs to drop will be dropped; namely conflict files).\n\nIt is possible to do the same things using libgit2.","files":null}]}
