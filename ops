I think I have tracked it down to the lock taking on line 502 of \"cache/repo_cache_bug.go\".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I don't know enough about the code to find the root cause at the moment......                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Side question:  In order to remove the bug I removed the branch from the \"refs/bugs\" folder and then deleted the git-bug                                                                                           cache....Should that work?","files":null}]}
