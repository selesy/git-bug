Hower, if you press enter on an issue and go back, its time gets set to the correct time. If you close termui and run again though, you get \"A long while ago\" again.\n\nI searched in existing issues, the closest I could find was https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/37, but not sure if it's related","files":null}]}
