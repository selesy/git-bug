When you open a bug, the whole series of commit is loaded from git and the cache is updated (I think ... not sure if it's actually updated if you don't make any change to the bug). This suggest that your cache is somehow not reflecting the actual state of those bugs. A crash can very much do that. \n\nTo check that, you can either simply delete your cache (`.git/git-bug/bug-cache`), or make a change to those bugs to force the update of the cache.","files":null}]}
