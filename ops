It saves some bytes and CPU, and there is no point in having something more precise in the cache than in the actual data. Part of that change include having unexported fields in BugExcerpt for the timestamps and some methods to export various format nicely for the rest of the code.\n\nThe problem is that I'm using golang's `gob` serialization format. This format will silently ignore unexported fields. This make no sense to me really as it tie together two different problematic: how we want to store and how we want to export the data in the code. This make me sad a little bit.","files":null},{"type":2,"timestamp":1594765335,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzU0NjE0NTc4NA=="},"nonce":"rdjfda5Ex5nbDoRqOn4IwXgtdoI=","title":"cache: timestamps are not written properly on disk","was":"cache: timestamps are not written properly on disk"},{"type":5,"timestamp":1594765342,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzU0NjE0NjA0OA=="},"nonce":"dJ3f82R2OY6TcAGgyzWkwFDPB+M=","added":[],"removed":["bridge"]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1594765342,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDYxNDYwNTA="},"nonce":"JbenWcaIesZy0SbrU+/4coJES6s=","added":["Core"],"removed":[]}]}
