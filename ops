One for bugs (from pushing refspec refs/bugs/*) and one for identities (from pushing refspec refs/identities/*). This implies the user shall enter its credential twice when working with a remote repository requireing credential.\nConsider merging the two `git push` into a single invoke to make git-bug use more natural and easier.\n\nI didn't check yet how this can be fixed, I just guess making one `git push \u003cremote\u003e refs/identities/* refs/bugs/*` should do the expected job. Just need to check how git-bug's push command is implemented and how the two current git command are distributed in classes and related implementation files to figure out what is the needed effort to fix this.","files":null}]}
