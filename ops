I didn't want to conflict with that so I went with `git-bug` that was unused and not that bad.\n\nNamespace grab in git command: some git developers complained about the namespace grab because they might want to make a bug command in the future. It also conflict with a command from the git-extra package. I'm considering dropping out of the git porcelain framework and renaming the binary `gb` or something else. No more conflict or namespace grab, and shorter commands. I haven't made my mind about that yet though.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1545598241,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA0MjYwMjkyOA=="},"nonce":"elPojBesH4tZWnB9LvQBLja7d5o=","status":2}]}
