This looks like a git bug really, because `~/.gitconfig.local` in your example is still the global config right ? So those entries should show up.\n\nOne thing that could be done is to use  `--global` when writing but not for reading, but that blur the line between local and global config. That could lead to other bugs.\n\nSome pointers:\nhttps://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/repository/config_git.go\nhttps://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/repository/git.go#L37-L45\n\nI want to eventually migrate to using go-git instead of relying on the command line (git-bug would directly interact with the repo instead of running git commands) so this problem might just be irrelevant in the future.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1592415356,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTUxODE3Ng==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/406#issuecomment-645518176"},"nonce":"WypBOuTAXPwypEo7SG5qo0Y/vU4=","message":"Also, storing credentials in the git config might just be a bad idea: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/327","files":null}]}
