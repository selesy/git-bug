I have to kill the process to get out.\n\n- this is only happening on FreeBSD\n- it is happening FreeBSD 11.3 and 12.1 (I've not tested with 12.0)\n- it is not happening on OpenBSD (tested on 6.6)\n- in FreeBSD, I used both the ports/pkg version (v0.7.1), but I also compiled v0.7.1, and v0.70 from src\n- it does not seem to be SHELL dependent (it happens in both zsh and bash)\n- I have built v0.5.0 from src and the problem does not happen there\n- I believe I first saw the problem on or about 2019-09-18 because of this comment: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/99#issuecomment-532893529 (I did not have time then to investigate further)\n- will try and investigate further, in the meantime, I'm asking other FreeBSD users to try and replicate\n\nFWIW, all other git-bug operations seem to work (add, ls, ls-label, etc.)","files":null}]}
