Then again, it's probably one of those things that needs some sort of configuration as it's never going to satisfy everybody.\n\nDefinitely. `git-bug` already use the git config here and there to configure behaviors (`git-bug.webui.open` for example). A `git-bug.termui.dense` option could make sense. That said, some of your changes make sense regardless.\n\n\u003e After fiddling some more, this is what I get:\n\u003e ![2020-07-15T132424](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017726/87539839-ee197680-c69e-11ea-8044-478e64463039.png)\n\nThe comment column is definitely better.\n\n\u003e As an argument for a config file, the hash length shouldn't probably be hard-coded, but at the very least fetched from the git config.\n\nImho this is more of a hash collision issue than a UI question. The length of a \"for human\" hash is defined only once in the core and all UIs use that. `git` itself use a single length when abbreviating a hash. 7 characters should be fine even for a dense UI, right?\n\n\u003e Having used \"tig\" for quite a while, I'm also a big fan of the abbreviated dates (\"2d\" to indicate \"2 days ago\"), but having that as a default is probably going to throw off some people.\n\nFor now this is done by using the default function of `go-humanize`. It seems to be possible to have a denser version. Maybe this could be tied to the same `dense` config ?\n\n\u003e Similarly, tig also does a great author abbreviation (which is also configurable) to conserve more space. \n\nHow so?","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1594823267,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDg4NDUwMDk="},"nonce":"Ip2lIYH1kmWEdTK0ctmay6KBmVA=","added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":5,"timestamp":1594823267,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDg4NDUwMTI="},"nonce":"eJwsvmmfzWlsIo+wcVTxHVvDxOU=","added":["TermUI"],"removed":[]}]}
