It seems to work but I think there is something I need to do in order to \"update the apollo cache\". I have no idea what that means but I read it in one of the tutorials I was following. The result is that the bug-list is out of date when you go back it it. I just hit refresh for now. I filed a bug to fix it :wink:.\n\n![add_bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1309820/67509544-21673180-f648-11e9-9ce7-cacb657d2265.gif)\n\nIn any case, I'm just tinkering around so if someone else wants to dedicate some real time to this please don't think I've claimed it or anything. I doubt I'll have much time to dedicate to it but I'd love to dig in a little more if I can. \n\n@hoijui I also am a complete n00b to react, graphql, and even JSX but I found it pretty easy to get started (I have some javascript experience though). The instructions at [webui/Readme.md][1] worked just fine and I just used a plain editor (vscode) to make my change. Feel free to take a look at [my branch][2] and diff it against the upstream to see how I implemented the feature.  \n\n[1]: https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/webui/Readme.md\n[2]: https://github.com/cheshirekow/git-bug/tree/cheshirekow-webui","files":null}]}
