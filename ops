Having a query for the bug you are assigned to come close but it's not the same thing.\n\nMy idea is to have the ability to favorite arbitrary bug and have a query to select the marked bugs. These metadata would not be persisted in the bug state but only locally.\n\nDoes that ring a bell for someone else ?","files":null}]}
