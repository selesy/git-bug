Unfortunately there just aren't many binary formats that are widely supported, except perhaps protobufs.\n\nJSON is probably your best bet. As you noted, it will be compressed anyway, and if performance is an issue you can always switch to a faster JSON encoder. The only big downside to JSON that I'm aware of is poor support for encoding binary blobs (`encoding/json` encodes `[]byte` as a base-64 string). But if `OperationPack` is almost entirely textual data anyway, there's little reason to worry about that.","files":null}]}
