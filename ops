Today I wanted to use it again, and git-bug complained about the incompatible metadata format.\n\nHowever I didn't want to upgrade the existing data, I just wanted to re-create the metadata from scratch.\n\nI actually had an hard time finding out all the places/refs that one needed to remove before git-bug was happy to initialize a new repository.\n\nI don't think a \"remove from repository\" command is necessary, but it would be nice to have an overview and/or list of commands that can be used to remove all refs, dirs and config entries used by git-bug from an existing repository.\n\nTo account for all past versions, so far these seem to be the following refs: ``refs/bugs/ refs/identities/ refs/remotes/*/bugs/``, the \"git-bug[.*]\" entries from ``.git/config``, the ``.git/git-bug directory``..
