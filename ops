They just landed a complete rewrite of this, so it's possible there is a bug lurking somewhere. The code generating the file is there: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/zsh_completions.go\n\nAs for the custom completion of bug ID, it seems that Cobra doesn't support that at the moment for ZSH: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/blob/master/zsh_completions.md\n\nThat said, it's very much in line with what they want to support (it's possible for bash). git-bug has the `ls-id` command so it would be pretty easy to plug there. Note though that all te git-bug commands support giving a simple prefix, so you don't need that much the completion.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1565779742,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTE5NzI2MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/38#issuecomment-521197261"},"nonce":"pZFM2ojfjtkb4xBp+0Ffxhvb0L0=","message":"The bracket problem is fixed with this PR upstream: https://github.com/spf13/cobra/pull/899","files":null}]}
