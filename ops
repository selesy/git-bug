The user ID would then be stored in a cookie or something, like any other web app.\n\nSee https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/tree/master/api/auth for the existing code about that: at the moment the webUI use a fixed user, the one active on the command line. You could implement a new middleware with those multi-user feature.\n\nAnother problem you will have when running as a server is that git-bug is not aware of normal git push if you expose it to your users. This means that if someone use `git bug push` to push bugs changes, the webUI will not be aware of it unless restarted. We would need some kind of git hook to fix that problem.","files":null}]}
