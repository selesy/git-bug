I use terminal config with bright background and there are parts of the tui that are not only **hard to read**, but **impossible** to read:\n\n![git-bug_ui_on_bright_bg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35028759/93748708-fd65f480-fbf8-11ea-891f-cf54e022d955.png)\n\nThat black rectangle in the screenshot above contains text \"No description provided.\", but the only way to find that is to open `git-bug` in different terminal with dark background.\n\nAs for configuration, why not use `.gitconfig` to do that? I see following advantages:\n\n* it is configuration file all git users know\n* having config for all `git` related tools in one place is nice\n* `git-bug` stores `git-bug.identity` in there so there should already be way to access it from code\n* `git` has `color` section that could be used for *some* `git-bug` elements\n* `git-bug.ui` section could store colors for elements missing from default `color`","files":null}]}
