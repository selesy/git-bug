I've added about 100 or so bugs and pushed/pulled about 5 or 6 times since creating the repository a couple of days ago...  and this is the first time I got this crash... so I'm not sure how common of a case it is.\n\nI'm not sure if this is helpful information, but the text of the error message below was printed about 1/2 way down the list of labels. Hopefully the error message is enough to narrow in on the code line. I wish I had also grabbed a screenshot to illustrate.\n\nI'm using the linux-amd64 binary from the 0.5.0 release on github.\n\n```\npanic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range          \n     [ ] json                    \ngoroutine 36 [running]:\ngithub.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/nsf/termbox-go.PollEvent(0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\n\t/home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/nsf/termbox-go/api.go:348 +0x8d4\ngithub.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/MichaelMure/gocui.(*Gui).MainLoop.func1(0xc000290000)\n\t/home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/MichaelMure/gocui/gui.go:354 +0x30\ncreated by github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/MichaelMure/gocui.(*Gui).MainLoop\n\t/home/travis/gopath/src/github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/MichaelMure/gocui/gui.go:352 +0x6e\n```","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1571872046,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTY3Mjc1MQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/233#issuecomment-545672751"},"nonce":"LM/rYyA04evGad0qcjgLC7jZDss=","message":"Got this again today.
