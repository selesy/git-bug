The plan is to have it eventually accept external authentication (OAuth typically) so that people without git commit access can participate on the bugtracker.\n\nBut having this implies that there is sometimes no logged user and the WebUI should be read-only at that point. Ideally this read-only feature is framed that way: not as a special hardcoded mode, but as a fallback when there is no logged user. It would then be just a matter of adding a new `--read-only` flag to the `webui` command to run the GraphQL API without a user.\n\nThis has some implication in the GraphQL API though: even if `Repository.userIdentity` in the GraphQL API can be null, there is still the assumption in some places (typically the mutations) that a user always exist. \n\nI very much welcome patches to do that.","files":null},{"type":5,"timestamp":1592218228,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0NDM4MDU0MzU="},"nonce":"m/LHNjF37XMCcp+OK/qEXru8AUM=","added":["enhancement"],"removed":[]},{"type":4,"timestamp":1593292163,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQ4OTQyODQ3OA=="},"nonce":"zNrI/DCVHRWuFRSmFMpVxFTi/14=","status":2}]}
