You can load more than one token, but you need to have them to begin with. Generally speaking, git-bug is a pretty bad issue transfer tool (for now).\n\nNow, if you configure two bridges, what's the behavior that you expect ? You could expect that bugs are pushed/pulled from both as you did (that is, pretty much a transfer tool), or you could expect that they stay segregated because you just want to centralize multiple source in a single local repo. In this latter case if git-bug fail to segregate bugs you are in a world of pain.\n\nBecause git-bug is a pretty bad transfer tool, I chose to segregate bugs to avoid problem for the common use case. In the future this could be relaxed *if* there is a way to control the behavior, with the segregation still being the default.","files":null},{"type":4,"timestamp":1594152236,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUyMjA3NTc3Mg=="},"nonce":"JkOs4uozI/wEGdq/HzAgeec7+Ss=","status":2}]}
