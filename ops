Background colours would also do.\n* Use 2 or more spaces, like:\n  ```\n  [q] Quit  [s] Search  [←↓↑→,hjkl] Navigation  [↵] Open bug  [n] New bug  [i] Pull  [o] Push\n  ```\n* Use multiple lines, like:\n  ```\n  Quit  Search  Navigation  Open bug  New bug  Pull  Push\n  [q]   [s]     [←↓↑→,hjkl] [↵]       [n]      [i]   [o]\n  ```\n* Use a connecting symbol (possibly also some unicode thing), like:\n  ```\n  [q]_Quit [s]_Search [←↓↑→,hjkl]_Navigation [↵]_Open bug [n]_New bug [i]_Pull [o]_Push\n  ```\n  ```\n  [q]·Quit [s]·Search [←↓↑→,hjkl]·Navigation [↵]·Open bug [n]·New bug [i]·Pull [o]·Push\n  ```\n* Use a separator symbols, like:\n  ```\n  [q] Quit · [s] Search · [←↓↑→,hjkl] Navigation · [↵] Open bug · [n] New bug · [i] Pull · [o] Push\n  ```","files":null}]}
