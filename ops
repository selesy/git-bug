I looked through the source code and I don't think I'm missing anything, but it would be great to be able to close a bug via `termui` when you are in a particular bug's view.\n\nIf that is in fact a feature that's missing, I'd be happy to work on a PR to add it. My apologies if it already exists and I just haven't figured it out yet! :smile:\n\nThanks!","files":null}]}
