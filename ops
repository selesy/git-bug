It's really awesome. I'd like to request a new feature:\n\u003e support hooks for comment and title messages\n\n`git` has a lot of [hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks). Among them, there is the `commit-msg` hook that one can use to audit/verify `COMMIT_EDITMSG`.\n\nFor example, [`commitlint`](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) provides a very convenient and standardized commit message rule set and helps improve the commit message quality for many projects such as [`Angular`](https://github.com/angular/angular).\n\nI'd like to be able to have the option to enforce commit message rules as I could with `commit-msg` hooks in vanilla `git`.\n\nThanks a lot for your work and attention.\n\nZhongming","files":null}]}
