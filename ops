On the termui it binds separately to \"push\" on the list view and to \"open/close issue\" on the issue view.\n\nSimilarly, the `u` key binds to \"up\" on gmail (go back from thread view to list view), while on termui it's `q` (which exits the app when on list view, so easy to mistype).\n\nDo you think this a change that would be useful?","files":null}]}
