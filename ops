The board will\nhave multiple columns, where each columns represents the current state of an\nIssue. An Issue will always be only in one columns and may be draged from one\ncolumn to another to alter it's state.\nE.g.\n\n```\n[TODO]     [WIP]   [Requires Review]   [DONE]\nIssue2     Issue1  Issue5              Issue4\nIssue3                                 Issue6\n```\n\nThe columns of the board may be implemented with labels. Then a column\nrepresents a query for all Issues with the specific label.\nE.g. The [WIP] column would list all Issues with the assigned label WIP.\nNOTE: As an Issue can only be in one column at a time, it must be ensured that\nthe Issue never has labels assigned which are also other columns in the board.\n\n\n\u003e Kanban are indeed a common feature of bug tracker. Obviously this will need to be be supported in git-bug's core, possibly with its own data-structure.\n\u003e\n\u003e As for https://github.com/GlancingMind/git-bug/issues/11 maybe you could implement the graphQL API with a mock (without persistence) to experiment with that in the webUI. I've noticed https://github.com/nishantpainter/personal-kanban that could fit the bill quite nicely.\n\u003e\n\u003e_Originally posted by @MichaelMure in https://github.com/GlancingMind/git-bug/issues/20#issuecomment-792834878_","files":null}]}
