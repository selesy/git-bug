If it were AND, it would return tickets `foo` and `bar` and exclude ticket `foobar`.\n\nSo yeah, I agree with using the Github behavior as a reference.","files":null},{"type":3,"timestamp":1568846267,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjg5MzUyOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/99#issuecomment-532893529"},"nonce":"d8xHZLezJ2zHHeDWdt20MRLVjj0=","message":"@MichaelMure I have a patch for this issue that I rebased against master that works on the command line (`git bug ls -l foo -L bar`), but I noticed that `git bug termui`is hanging in master, so I can't test it in the terminal ui.
