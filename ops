Identity separation stuff!\nI also very much liked when you said it could be a separate project!\nIt would be very annoying to have multiple systems of identity management for a single project (one for bugs, one for the wiki, ...), on the other hand, it would be a project.. even more meaningful then git-bug itsself, to have a well done distributed identity management. It could be useful well beyond git projects.\n\nI totally agree that having the model documentation more formal would be great!\nDo you have any ideas how you would like this done?\nThe thing that came to my mind now, is to use OWL/RDF.\nI am just learning about this for two other projects I got involved to, but it seems to fit somehow.","files":null}]}
