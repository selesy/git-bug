Then we can start implementing that.\n\nHaving PRs being enhanced bugs (that is sharing the same entity) is a possibility, but I'm a big afraid it would make things complex for no good reason. Remember that the way it's presented to the user doesn't have to match the data model.\n\nAnyone want to give it a try?","files":null}]}
