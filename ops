I can add new bug, but cannot use termui as well as the webui. Termui works without having any bugs by the way. When I tried to add new bug, it shuts the CLI down, so cannot see the error log. \n\n\u003e  Does git work in this repo ? \n\nIt does.\n\n\u003e Is there an error reported in the console when running as a normal user ?\n\nNormally there is none.  But as I mentioned above, when I add a new bug, every git-bug command started to fail. Even `ls`. Even with the `sudo`. Though there is an exception here, when I use webui with sudo, it does not crash and I can see the bug that I've created. \n\n\u003e Can you try by choosing a port yourself with git bug webui -p 1234 ?\n\nSame as above. Unless I am root, it does not listen the port.","files":null}]}
