For importing a public repo, any credential would do. For exporting, the bridge will match credentials based on the login, using whatever credential is needed for this specific piece of data.\n\nSo what could be done is for the bridges to store an additional information in their config: the login to use when importing (ie, the one used during the configuration). That would make more sense than using the first random one found.\n\n_Originally posted by @MichaelMure in https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/pull/250#issuecomment-587625833_","files":null}]}
