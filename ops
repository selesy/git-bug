That is, the maintainer of a project would put the git-bug binary on a server somewhere and run the webUI exposed on the internet. Ideally the webUI would accept external auth system like Github OAuth or others. When a new user would use those the first time, a new git-bug identity would be created in the git repo (by the go code) for later use.\n\u003e\n\u003e There is the premise of that system already:\n\u003e https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/tree/master/api/auth\n\u003e https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/blob/master/commands/webui.go#L92-L101\n\u003e\n\u003e All of that to say that what you are describing is **a login screen** for the webUI. With git-bug's current capability on that aspect, this login screen could have a dropdown of the existing identities. Later, support for those external auth system can be added.\n\u003e\n\u003e Note though that in a near future those existing identities might be \"locked\", in the sense that they will carry cryptographic keys and you will need to have the private key to use them.\n\u003e\n\u003e _Originally posted by @MichaelMure in https://github.com/GlancingMind/git-bug/issues/13#issuecomment-792828040_","files":null},{"type":2,"timestamp":1619023466,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDYyNjE1NTM0OQ=="},"nonce":"NWh9byLGgwymRGEG5NTo54dXsIM=","title":"WebUI: Add Login page with OAuth support.","was":"WebUI: Add Login page with OAuth support."},{"type":3,"timestamp":1619023595,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNDIwNjgxOQ==","github-url":"https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/issues/640#issuecomment-824206819"},"nonce":"GzUI3t4dt3inymePFSg7FQVu6UI=","message":"[IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth) might be another option to the common OAuth options.","files":null}]}
