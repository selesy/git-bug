So, as an illustration, can a bug follow and \"adapt\" to a branch same as the source-code does?\n\nA possibly different, additional feature:\nMost all other systems require a bug to manually track all the related branches (to the bug). It might be nice for a \"built-in\" (like git-bug) system to do this implicitly, or some flavor of \"automatically.\"","files":null}]}
