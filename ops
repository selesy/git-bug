It seems that the gitlab bridge is now unable to import the status changes of an issue (open/close).\n\nThis is not due to a broken code in git-bug, it's due to a gitlab API change. It seems that the \"Notes\" API is not listing those events anymore. More debugging is required to see if this information appears in another way. If not, we'll have to checks the issue status at the time of the import and create a status change if necessary. Very less than ideal.\n\nI won't rant to much here but there is reasons I should (do they even have a changelog??).","files":null}]}
