A few notes:\n\n- require two new Operations\n- as the data model is immutable, it would not fully erase the previous comment version. While it would not be visible in the UI anymore, it would still be readable through the bug history.\n- in bug.Snapshot, a proper `Timeline` needs to be implemented and would replace the current usage of `Operations`. This `Timeline` would hold the data that is expected to be displayed in a UI, instead of the raw stream of events","files":null}]}
