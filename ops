The data could be used to auto-generate reports that I can give to customers showing progress. \n\nIt doesn't have to be a bridge, I just figured that a bridge would be the easiest way to get the data out of the system since you're already pulling the data out of the system to send it to other 3rd party services.","files":null}]}
