I wanted to try and write some code for it, but I am unfamiliar with go.\n\nThe \"make\" command complained about missing packages, so I ran:\n\n$ go get github.com/spf13/cobra/doc\n$ go get github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/commands\n\nNow, make fails with another error:\n\n$ make\ngo generate\n# command-line-arguments\ndoc/gen_markdown.go:20:28: cannot use commands.RootCmd (type *\"github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/vendor/github.com/spf13/cobra\".Command) as type *\"github.com/spf13/cobra\".Command in argument to doc.GenMarkdownTree\ngit-bug.go:1: running \"go\": exit status 2\nmake: *** [Makefile:4: build] Error 1\n\n\nI feel like README.md should have specific instructions for developers. Experienced Golang devs will not learn much, but it would be really helpful for people like me.","files":null}]}
